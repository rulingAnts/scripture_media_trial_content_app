# Implementation Summary: Advanced Playback Limits

## Overview
This implementation adds four new advanced playback limit features to the Scripture Media Trial Content App, giving content creators fine-grained control over how media can be accessed.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Minimum Interval Between Plays
- **What**: Required waiting period between successive plays
- **Format**: Days, hours, and minutes (converted to milliseconds)
- **Storage**: `minIntervalBetweenPlaysMs` in bundle config
- **Enforcement**: Checks time since `lastPlay` timestamp
- **UI**: Three input fields (days, hours, minutes) in desktop app
- **Mobile**: Shows "Must wait X minutes between plays" when blocked

### 2. Maximum Total Plays (Lifetime Limit)
- **What**: Absolute limit on plays across all time
- **Format**: Integer (optional, null = unlimited)
- **Storage**: `maxPlaysTotal` in bundle config, `playsTotal` in mobile storage
- **Enforcement**: Increments on each play, permanently locks when limit reached
- **UI**: Single input field in desktop app
- **Mobile**: Shows "X / Y total" and "Locked: Lifetime limit reached"

### 3. Bundle Expiration Date
- **What**: Date/time after which bundle becomes permanently locked
- **Format**: ISO 8601 datetime string (optional)
- **Storage**: `expirationDate` in bundle config
- **Enforcement**: Compares current time to expiration, includes tamper detection
- **UI**: Datetime picker in desktop app
- **Mobile**: Shows "Bundle expired on [date]. Permanently locked."

### 4. Time Tampering Detection
- **What**: Detects if user sets device clock backward
- **Format**: ISO 8601 datetime string
- **Storage**: `lastKnownTime` in mobile storage
- **Enforcement**: Checks if current time < last known time
- **Effect**: Permanently locks bundle if tampering detected
- **Mobile**: Shows "Time tampering detected. Bundle is permanently locked."

### 5. Flexible Time Units (Enhancement)
- **What**: All time intervals support days, hours, minutes (not just hours)
- **Format**: Stored as milliseconds internally
- **UI**: Three input fields for each time setting
- **Conversion**: `(days × 86400000) + (hours × 3600000) + (minutes × 60000)`
- **Backward compatibility**: Mobile app reads old `resetIntervalHours` format

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
Desktop App (Electron)
  └─> Creates bundle with limits
      └─> Bundle Config (JSON, encrypted)
          └─> Mobile App (Flutter)
              └─> Enforces all limits
              └─> Tracks usage in SharedPreferences
```

### Data Flow

**Bundle Creation (Desktop):**
1. User sets limits in UI
2. Renderer.js collects values and converts to milliseconds
3. Main.js creates bundle config with limits
4. Config encrypted and bundled with media files

**Playback Check (Mobile):**
1. User attempts to play media
2. `_canPlayCurrent()` checks all limits in order:
   - Time tampering (permanent lock)
   - Bundle expiration (permanent lock)
   - Total plays limit (permanent lock)
   - Minimum interval between plays (temporary block)
   - Windowed plays limit (temporary block)
3. Returns early if any check fails
4. Shows appropriate error message

### Storage Schema (Mobile)

```
SharedPreferences keys:
- lastKnownTime: ISO string (global)
- playsUsed:{bundleId}:{fileName}: int
- playsTotal:{bundleId}:{fileName}: int
- lastPlay:{bundleId}:{fileName}: milliseconds since epoch
- playWindowStart:{bundleId}:{fileName}: milliseconds since epoch
```

### Bundle Config Schema v2.0

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "bundleId": "...",
  "expirationDate": "2024-12-31T23:59:59.000Z",  // NEW
  "playbackLimits": {
    "default": {
      "maxPlays": 3,
      "resetIntervalMs": 86400000,              // NEW (replaces resetIntervalHours)
      "minIntervalBetweenPlaysMs": 300000,      // NEW
      "maxPlaysTotal": 10                        // NEW
    }
  }
}
```

## Files Modified

### Shared Library
- `shared/src/bundle-schema.js` - Added new fields to schema
- `shared/src/playback-tracker.js` - Implemented all limit checks

### Desktop App
- `desktop-app/src/index.html` - Added UI fields
- `desktop-app/src/renderer.js` - Added UI logic and validation
- `desktop-app/src/main.js` - Added expiration date to bundle creation

### Mobile App
- `mobile_app/lib/main.dart` - Implemented all checks and UI updates

### Documentation
- `ADVANCED_PLAYBACK_LIMITS.md` - Comprehensive user guide
- `examples/example-bundle-config.json` - Updated example

## Testing Results

### Automated Tests
✓ Bundle configuration creation with new limits
✓ Interval enforcement (blocked immediate replay)
✓ Expiration date checking (blocked expired bundles)
✓ Total play limits (blocked after 10 plays)
✓ Time tampering detection (blocked backward clock)

### Manual Verification
✓ JavaScript syntax validation (all files)
✓ Desktop app dependencies installed
✓ Code review passed (2 minor npm comments, not issues)
✓ Security scan passed (0 vulnerabilities)

## Security Considerations

### Tamper Protection
- Bundle config encrypted with shared key
- Integrity hash prevents modification
- Time tampering detection prevents clock manipulation
- All permanent locks persist across app restarts

### Attack Vectors Addressed
1. **Clock manipulation**: Detected and causes permanent lock
2. **Bundle modification**: Integrity hash verification
3. **Re-importing old bundle**: Prevented by bundle tracking
4. **Excessive retries**: Each attempt checks limits

### Remaining Considerations
- Device ID still user-accessible (could be spoofed)
- Rooted/jailbroken devices could bypass storage
- Local encryption keys derivable from device ID
- These are acknowledged limitations per SECURITY.md

## Use Cases Enabled

### 1. Time-Limited Trials
```
Max plays: 3 per day
Reset: 24 hours
Min interval: 15 minutes
Total: 6 plays
Expiration: End of month
```
Result: 2 days of evaluation, then permanently expires

### 2. Consultant Review
```
Max plays: 5 per 12 hours
Reset: 12 hours
Min interval: None
Total: None
Expiration: Review deadline
```
Result: Intensive review period with deadline

### 3. Community Testing
```
Max plays: 10 per week
Reset: 7 days
Min interval: 1 hour
Total: 50
Expiration: 3 months
```
Result: Extended testing with usage pacing

## Known Limitations

1. **No unlock mechanism**: Permanent locks cannot be undone
   - Solution: Create new bundle if needed

2. **Clock-based limits vulnerable to forward manipulation**: User can fast-forward clock
   - Mitigated by: Expiration date eventually triggers
   - Detected by: Backward manipulation is caught

3. **No network verification**: All checks are local
   - By design: Offline-first architecture

4. **No bundle updates**: Cannot change limits after creation
   - Solution: Create new bundle with new limits

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

- Per-file expiration dates (currently bundle-level only)
- Grace periods for expired bundles
- Usage analytics/reporting
- Network-based limit verification
- Biometric authentication for high-value content

## Backward Compatibility

**Not maintained per user request**. However:
- Mobile app can read old `resetIntervalHours` format for testing
- Converts to milliseconds automatically
- Desktop app only creates new format (v2.0)

## Migration Path

For existing deployments:
1. No migration needed (app not released yet per user)
2. All new bundles use v2.0 format
3. Old test bundles may still work on mobile if using old format

## Success Criteria

✅ All four features implemented
✅ Desktop UI supports all features
✅ Mobile app enforces all limits
✅ Time tampering detected and blocked
✅ Automated tests pass
✅ Code review passed
✅ Security scan passed
✅ Documentation complete

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully adds comprehensive playback control features while maintaining code quality and security. All user requirements have been met:

1. ✅ Interval between plays (5 min, 15 min, etc.)
2. ✅ Absolute total play limit (6 times ever, etc.)
3. ✅ Bundle expiration date with tamper protection
4. ✅ Flexible time units (days, hours, minutes)
5. ✅ Both desktop and mobile apps updated

The changes are ready for release.
