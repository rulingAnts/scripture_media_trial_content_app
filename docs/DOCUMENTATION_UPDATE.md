# Documentation Update Summary

## Changes Made

This document summarizes the documentation reorganization completed on November 1, 2025.

### Problem Addressed

1. **Outdated Technology References**: Documentation incorrectly referenced "React Native 0.72" when the mobile app is actually built with Flutter.
2. **Too Many Files**: 23 markdown files in the repository root made it difficult to find information.
3. **Overlapping Content**: Similar information was duplicated across multiple files.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Technology Stack Corrections

Updated all references throughout documentation:
- ❌ ~~React Native 0.72~~ → ✅ Flutter SDK 3.9.2+
- ❌ ~~react-native-device-info~~ → ✅ Platform-specific device ID retrieval
- ❌ ~~AsyncStorage~~ → ✅ SharedPreferences
- ❌ ~~react-native-video~~ → ✅ video_player package
- ✅ AES encryption still accurate (CryptoJS on desktop, encrypt package on mobile)

#### 2. Documentation Consolidation

**Before**: 23 markdown files in root  
**After**: 7 well-organized markdown files in root + archived documentation

**New Structure**:

| New File | Purpose | Consolidated From |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| **README.md** | Project overview & quick links | (Updated, not merged) |
| **GETTING_STARTED.md** | Setup and quick start guide | SETUP.md, QUICKSTART.md, parts of APK_BUILDING_GUIDE.md |
| **USER_GUIDE.md** | Usage instructions & troubleshooting | USAGE.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md, relevant sections from other docs |
| **TECHNICAL.md** | Architecture & security details | ARCHITECTURE.md, SECURITY.md, SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md, technical sections |
| **COMMUNITY.md** | FAQ & contributing guidelines | FAQ.md, CONTRIBUTING.md |
| **CHANGELOG.md** | Version history | (Updated for accuracy) |
| **TODO.md** | Roadmap & future features | (Simplified and updated) |

**Archived Documentation** (moved to `docs/archive/`):

- ADVANCED_PLAYBACK_LIMITS.md
- PLAYLIST_LIMITS.md
- SMBUNDLE_FILE_ASSOCIATION.md
- TESTING_FILE_ASSOCIATION.md
- UI_CHANGES.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_DETAILS.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_FILE_ASSOCIATION.md
- APK_BUILDING_GUIDE.md
- NEXT_STEPS.md
- KNOWN_ISSUES.md

**Removed Files** (content consolidated):

- SETUP.md → merged into GETTING_STARTED.md
- QUICKSTART.md → merged into GETTING_STARTED.md
- USAGE.md → merged into USER_GUIDE.md
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md → merged into USER_GUIDE.md
- ARCHITECTURE.md → merged into TECHNICAL.md
- SECURITY.md → merged into TECHNICAL.md
- SECURITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md → merged into TECHNICAL.md
- FAQ.md → merged into COMMUNITY.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md → merged into COMMUNITY.md

### Benefits

1. **Easier Navigation**: 7 focused documents instead of 23
2. **Accurate Information**: Correct technology stack throughout
3. **Better Organization**: Related content grouped together
4. **Preserved Details**: Specialized docs archived, not deleted
5. **Clear Entry Points**: Each document has a clear purpose

### Documentation Map

```
Root Documentation (7 files)
├── README.md              # Start here - project overview
├── GETTING_STARTED.md     # Setup, installation, first bundle
├── USER_GUIDE.md          # Usage, features, troubleshooting
├── TECHNICAL.md           # Architecture, security, implementation
├── COMMUNITY.md           # FAQ, contributing, support
├── CHANGELOG.md           # Version history
└── TODO.md                # Future features

Archived Documentation (docs/archive/)
└── 11 specialized documents for reference
```

### Finding Information

**I want to...**

- **Get started quickly** → GETTING_STARTED.md
- **Learn how to use the app** → USER_GUIDE.md
- **Understand the architecture** → TECHNICAL.md
- **Find security details** → TECHNICAL.md (Security section)
- **Ask a question** → COMMUNITY.md (FAQ section)
- **Contribute** → COMMUNITY.md (Contributing section)
- **See what's planned** → TODO.md
- **Check version history** → CHANGELOG.md
- **Find implementation details** → docs/archive/

### Migration Notes

If you have bookmarks or links to old documentation:

| Old File | New Location |
|----------|--------------|
| SETUP.md | GETTING_STARTED.md |
| QUICKSTART.md | GETTING_STARTED.md |
| USAGE.md | USER_GUIDE.md |
| TROUBLESHOOTING.md | USER_GUIDE.md |
| ARCHITECTURE.md | TECHNICAL.md |
| SECURITY.md | TECHNICAL.md |
| FAQ.md | COMMUNITY.md |
| CONTRIBUTING.md | COMMUNITY.md |
| ADVANCED_PLAYBACK_LIMITS.md | docs/archive/ |
| (other specialized docs) | docs/archive/ |

### Verification

To verify the changes:

```bash
# Count markdown files in root (should be 7)
ls *.md | wc -l

# List root markdown files
ls -1 *.md

# List archived documentation
ls -1 docs/archive/*.md

# Search for "React Native" (should only appear in CHANGELOG for historical context)
grep -r "React Native" *.md

# Search for "Flutter" (should appear in technical docs)
grep -r "Flutter" *.md
```

### Accuracy Checklist

- ✅ All "React Native" references updated to "Flutter"
- ✅ Technology stack accurately reflects current implementation
- ✅ Mobile app correctly described as Flutter/Dart
- ✅ Encryption details accurate (AES-256)
- ✅ File paths and structures match repository
- ✅ Build commands reflect actual scripts
- ✅ Package names correct (pubspec.yaml dependencies)
- ✅ No broken internal links

### Feedback

If you notice any issues with the new documentation structure:
- Missing information from old docs
- Broken links or references
- Inaccurate technical details
- Organization issues

Please open a GitHub issue with details.
