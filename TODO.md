# Roadmap & Future Features

This document outlines planned enhancements and future development priorities.

## High Priority

### iOS Support
- Port mobile app to iOS
- iOS-specific device identification
- iOS secure storage implementation
- Testing on iOS devices
- Xcode project configuration

### Security Enhancements
- Root detection and warning system
- Code obfuscation for mobile app
- Tamper detection for APK modifications
- Hardware security module integration
- Screen recording detection (limited on Android)

### Testing Infrastructure
- Unit tests for encryption utilities
- Integration tests for bundle workflows
- Automated security testing
- Cross-device compatibility testing

## Medium Priority

### Playback Limits: Advanced Features

Refer to `docs/archive/ADVANCED_PLAYBACK_LIMITS.md` and `docs/archive/PLAYLIST_LIMITS.md` for detailed specifications. Summary:

- **Geofencing**: Reset or grant extra plays based on location changes
- **Per-media granular overrides**: More fine-grained control per file
- **Enhanced cooldown options**: More flexible interval configurations
- **Better expiration handling**: More sophisticated expiration rules

### User Experience
- Progress indicators for bundle creation and import
- Better error messages with suggested solutions
- Localization for more languages (currently supports 12 languages in desktop app)
- In-app help and tutorials

### Content Management
- Desktop app ability to open and edit existing .smbundle files
- Batch operations for multiple bundles
- Bundle templates for common configurations
- Bundle versioning and update mechanism

## Low Priority

### Analytics & Monitoring
- Privacy-preserving usage analytics (opt-in)
- Bundle distribution tracking
- Performance monitoring
- Error reporting (opt-in)

### Advanced Features
- Watermarking for traceability
- Remote bundle revocation capability
- Multi-device bundles with different keys per device
- Server-side validation option (for online scenarios)
- Compressed/optimized media encoding

### Developer Tools
- Bundle validation tools
- Device ID management utilities
- Automated testing suite
- CI/CD pipeline improvements
