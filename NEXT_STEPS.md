## What You Need to Do Next

### 1. Build the APK

Since Flutter is not available in the CI environment, you'll need to build locally:

```bash
cd scripture_media_trial_content_app
scripts/build_apk.sh
```

Or for a release build:
```bash
scripts/build_apk.sh --release
```

### 2. Test on Android Device

Follow the detailed testing guide in `TESTING_FILE_ASSOCIATION.md`. Key scenarios to test:

#### Test 1: File Manager
1. Transfer a .smbundle file to your device
2. Open file manager
3. Tap the .smbundle file
4. Select "Scripture Demo Player"
5. Verify the bundle imports automatically

#### Test 2: WhatsApp
1. Receive a .smbundle file via WhatsApp
2. Tap the file
3. Tap "Share" or "Open with"
4. Select "Scripture Demo Player"
5. Verify automatic import

#### Test 3: Email
1. Email yourself a .smbundle file
2. Open email on device
3. Tap attachment
4. Select "Scripture Demo Player"
5. Verify automatic import

### 3. Verify Expected Behaviors

Check that:
- [ ] Android shows "Scripture Demo Player" as an app option for .smbundle files
- [ ] Files open and process automatically without manual import button
- [ ] Invalid files show appropriate error messages
- [ ] All existing security checks still work
- [ ] App doesn't crash with corrupted files

### 4. Review Documentation

Read through the created documentation:
- **SMBUNDLE_FILE_ASSOCIATION.md** - Understand how it works
- **TESTING_FILE_ASSOCIATION.md** - Testing scenarios and troubleshooting
- **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY_FILE_ASSOCIATION.md** - Complete overview

## Troubleshooting

If file association doesn't work:

1. **Reinstall the app:**
   ```bash
   scripts/build_apk.sh --uninstall-first
   ```

2. **Check logcat for errors:**
   ```bash
   adb logcat | grep -i scripture
   ```

3. **Verify intent filters:**
   ```bash
   adb shell pm dump net.iraobi.scripturedemoplayer | grep -A 20 "intent-filter"
   ```

## Merging the Changes

Once testing is successful:

1. Review the PR on GitHub
2. Ensure all commits are clean
3. Merge the branch `copilot/associate-smbundle-files-app` into main
4. Tag the release if desired
