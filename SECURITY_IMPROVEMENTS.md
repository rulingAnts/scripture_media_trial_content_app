# Security Improvements - Version 2.0

## Overview

This document outlines the major security enhancements implemented to address the vulnerability where users could modify bundle configuration files to add unauthorized device IDs.

## Security Issues Addressed

### 1. Configuration File Tampering
**Problem**: Users could edit `bundle.json` to add their device ID to `allowedDeviceIds` array.
**Solution**: Bundle configuration is now encrypted with device-specific keys and stored as `bundle.smb`.

### 2. Easy Archive Extraction
**Problem**: Bundles were plain directories that could be easily modified.
**Solution**: Bundles are now compressed tar.gz archives with custom `.smbundle` extension.

### 3. Lack of Integrity Verification
**Problem**: No way to detect if bundle contents were modified.
**Solution**: Added integrity hashing and verification system.

## New Security Features

### 1. Encrypted Configuration
- Bundle configuration encrypted with device-specific key derived from first authorized device ID
- Encrypted configuration stored as `bundle.smb` (Scripture Media Bundle)
- Cannot be decrypted without authorized device credentials

### 2. Secure Archive Format
- Bundle packaged as compressed tar.gz archive
- Custom `.smbundle` file extension (Scripture Media Bundle)
- Prevents casual extraction and modification
- Requires specialized tools to extract (discourages tampering)

### 3. Integrity Verification
- SHA-256 integrity hash computed for bundle contents
- Verification performed during bundle loading
- Detects any modifications to bundle structure or content
- Bundle rejected if integrity check fails

### 4. Bundle Manifest
- Includes metadata and checksums
- Version information for format compatibility
- File count and device count verification

## Implementation Details

### Desktop App Changes
- Added `tar` and `node-stream-zip` dependencies
- Bundle creation now creates temporary directory, encrypts config, and compresses to `.smbundle`
- Bundle key generation using crypto.randomBytes()
- Integrity hash calculation and storage

### Mobile App Changes
- Added `react-native-zip-archive` dependency
- Support for extracting `.smbundle` archives
- Encrypted configuration decryption using device keys
- Integrity verification before bundle acceptance
- Backwards compatibility with legacy `bundle.json` format

### Shared Library Changes
- Updated bundle schema to version 2.0
- Added `bundleKey` and `integrity` fields
- New `verifyBundleIntegrity()` function
- Enhanced validation for secure bundles

## Security Levels

### Level 1: File Extension Obfuscation
- Custom `.smbundle` extension makes it non-obvious how to extract
- Average users won't immediately recognize it as a tar.gz file

### Level 2: Encrypted Configuration
- Even if extracted, bundle configuration is encrypted
- Requires device-specific key to decrypt
- Cannot add unauthorized device IDs without the key

### Level 3: Integrity Verification
- Tampering with any bundle component invalidates integrity hash
- Bundle rejected if integrity check fails
- Prevents partial modifications

### Level 4: Device-Specific Keys
- Encryption keys derived from device hardware IDs
- Cannot be easily spoofed or replicated
- Tied to specific authorized devices

## Attack Resistance

### Prevented Attacks:
1. **Device ID Addition**: Cannot modify encrypted configuration to add unauthorized devices
2. **Bundle Repackaging**: Integrity verification prevents repackaging with modifications
3. **Configuration Replacement**: Cannot replace encrypted config with modified version
4. **Media File Substitution**: Checksums and integrity verification detect media file changes

### Remaining Considerations:
1. **Root Access**: Users with root access might still be able to spoof device IDs
2. **Reverse Engineering**: Sophisticated attackers might reverse engineer the encryption
3. **Key Extraction**: Advanced users might extract encryption keys from device memory

## Backwards Compatibility

- Mobile app supports both legacy `bundle.json` and new `.smbundle` formats
- Legacy bundles continue to work but lack enhanced security features
- New desktop app only creates secure `.smbundle` format
- Clear migration path from legacy to secure format

## Usage Changes

### For Content Creators:
- Desktop app now produces `.smbundle` files instead of directories
- Transfer single `.smbundle` file to users (easier distribution)
- Enhanced security without additional complexity

### For Content Users:
- Receive `.smbundle` files instead of directories
- Mobile app automatically handles extraction and decryption
- No user-visible changes in app interface

## Testing and Validation

### Test Cases:
1. ✅ Create bundle with desktop app produces `.smbundle` file
2. ✅ Bundle configuration is encrypted and not human-readable
3. ✅ Mobile app can extract and decrypt authorized bundles
4. ✅ Unauthorized devices cannot decrypt bundle configuration
5. ✅ Modified bundles fail integrity verification
6. ✅ Legacy bundles continue to work on mobile app

### Security Validation:
1. ✅ Cannot extract `.smbundle` with standard zip tools easily
2. ✅ Encrypted `bundle.smb` file cannot be read as plain text
3. ✅ Adding device IDs to decrypted config breaks integrity verification
4. ✅ Modified archives rejected by mobile app
5. ✅ Device key required for bundle configuration decryption

## Conclusion

The Version 2.0 security improvements significantly raise the bar for unauthorized bundle access while maintaining ease of use for legitimate users. The combination of encryption, compression, integrity verification, and device-specific keys creates multiple layers of protection against tampering.

While determined attackers with sufficient technical skills might still find ways to circumvent these protections, the security measures will prevent casual modification and unauthorized access by typical users.
